# [Arma 3] Front Defence
Front Defense is a fast-paced, dynamic multiplayer PVE battle-simulation. FD is persistent and involves taking sectors in order to gain funding to purchase new assets. FD uses a unique algorithm to keep gameplay intense, making both sides aware of each others general positions as well as a calculated battle-front.

FD can be used on any map and will dynamically create sectors based on the maps locations, requiring no setup. All you need to do is place a few required items on the map, see [deployment.md]() for more instructions.
