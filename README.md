# Front Defence: Germany
Front Defense is a fast-paced, dynamic multiplayer PVE battle-simulation. FD is persistent and involves taking sectors in order to gain funding to purchase new assets. FD uses a unique algorithm to keep gameplay intense, making both sides aware of each others general positions as well as a calculated battle-front.
